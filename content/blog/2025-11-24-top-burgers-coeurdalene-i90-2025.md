# Top Burgers in Coeur d’Alene Along I‑90: Where Flavor Takes the Wheel

CDA punches way above its weight class when it comes to burgers. Here’s where I’d send any road‑tripper who wants something better than another sad fast‑food drive‑through.

## 1. Hudson’s Hamburgers — The Legend

Since 1907. Still killing it.  
**Must‑try:** A double with onions and their signature spicy sauce.

## 2. Crafted Tap House + Kitchen — Gourmet Without the Attitude

High‑end burgers that don’t feel pretentious.  
**Must‑try:** The _Vandal Burger_. Yes, the name is ironic, Idaho fans.

## 3. Sickies Garage — Big, Messy, Beautiful

These burgers are wild—in the best way.  
**Must‑try:** Glazed‑donut burger if you’re feeling dangerous.

## Why CDA Burgers Matter on I‑90

Because sometimes you need a real meal, not highway‑adjacent sadness. And CDA delivers every time.
