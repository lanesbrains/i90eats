# M-80 Chicken Confirms Permanent Downtown Missoula Location: The Ultimate Hot Chicken Hunt Ends

**MISSOULA, MT** — The era of frantic social media checking and racing across town to catch Missoula's favorite food truck is officially over. **M-80 Chicken** has traded its four wheels for a permanent, high-visibility storefront in the heart of **Downtown Missoula**.

This transition from food truck phenomenon to established restaurant marks a major milestone for the city's dynamic food scene. Known for its perfectly crispy, ridiculously hot chicken, M-80 built a cult following based on quality, spice, and scarcity. Now, the dedicated location promises consistent access to its full menu, including the infamous seven-level heat challenge. If you know me, you know that _scarcity_ is the enemy of a good meal. Now, we have consistency.

The move into a static space on West Main Street allows for expanded kitchen capacity, which is critical for handling the consistent demand that often led to early sell-outs. This is fantastic news for I-90 travelers: instead of a risky detour, you now have a guaranteed stop for Montana's most explosive fried chicken.

Missoula's culinary landscape is evolving rapidly, and M-80 Chicken’s commitment to a permanent downtown fixture confirms the city's appetite for high-quality, high-impact dining. Secure your spot in line; the heat is staying on.
