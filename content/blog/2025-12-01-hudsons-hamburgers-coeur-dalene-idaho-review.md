# Burgers, Pie, and No Fries: Hudson’s Hamburgers is I-90’s Oldest, Boldest Comfort Stop

When you cross into Idaho from Spokane, you’re looking for a quick, quality, authentic stop. You could settle for a chain, but I, The Breakfast King, demand better. You need **Hudson’s Hamburgers** in Coeur d'Alene, a place that has been operating with the same minimalist menu since **1907**.

### The Menu: A Study in Confidence

The menu is the first sign of greatness: Hamburgers, Cheeseburgers (single or double), Ham Sandwich, Egg Sandwich, and **Pie**. That is it.

They have two rules you must respect:

1.  **No Fries:** If you ask, you're a tourist. They serve chips or their phenomenal pie.
2.  **No Lettuce/Tomato:** Your choices are pickles, onions, and their legendary "hot ketchup." This is not a garden salad; this is a burger.

### The Burger Build

Every burger is hand-pattied and griddled right in front of you on a seasoned-for-a-century flat top. The beef has that characteristic old-school char and juiciness that only comes from decades of tradition. I ordered the double cheeseburger, and let me tell you, it is pure, greasy, counter-stool poetry. They don't need fancy toppings because the quality of the beef and the flat-top cooking does the heavy lifting.

### The Best Dessert on I-90?

What really sets Hudson's apart is the **pie**. After a perfect, simple burger, you are immediately faced with towering lemon meringue or seasonal fruit pies. It’s an insane pairing—a no-frills comfort burger chased by a perfect slice of baked heaven. For a quick, quality stop near the Washington border, this place beats any late-night spot in Spokane, even the ones I ranked (though you should definitely check out that list of [Spokane Late-Night Eats](/spokane-late-night-food-ranking-satellite-diner)).

Hudson’s is a mandatory pilgrimage for any I-90 traveler who respects history, quality, and a confident menu.
