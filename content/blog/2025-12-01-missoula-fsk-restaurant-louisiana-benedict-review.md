# The Cajun Conundrum: Discovering the Louisiana Benedict at Missoula’s FSK

From the moment you step into **FSK (Fork, Spoon, Knife)**, the atmosphere suggests elevated diner classics, but nothing prepares you for the sheer ambition of their menu. This is the new venture from chefs with serious local pedigree, and it shows. I came in expecting excellent biscuits; I left a changed man after encountering the **Louisiana Benedict.**

This is not your standard brunch fare. It begins with the simple architecture of a Benedict, but the foundation is revolutionary: perfectly spiced **breakfast egg rolls**, fried to a light, golden crisp. Perched atop these crunchy bases are two flawlessly poached eggs, waiting to unleash their molten gold.

The true star, however, is the **Cajun Hollandaise sauce.** It is rich and tangy, carrying a bold, smoky heat that hits the back of the palate before the buttery texture soothes it. The entire composition is a textural and flavor masterpiece—the crunch of the roll, the velvet of the yolk, and the slow, building spice of the sauce. As The Breakfast King, I demand _perfection_ in the morning, and this dish delivers fusion greatness.

FSK has succeeded in creating a destination breakfast dish that anchors Missoula’s growing reputation for culinary risk-taking. Do yourself a favor and plan your I-90 stop around this meal. If you need lunch, you can always hit up the [M-80 Chicken](/m80-chicken-downtown-missoula-permanent-location-open) downtown.
