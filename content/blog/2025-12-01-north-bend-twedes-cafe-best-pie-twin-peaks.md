# The Only Pie Worth Pulling Off I-90 For: A Visit to Twede's Cafe

If you've driven the entire I-90, you deserve a reward. Forget the fancy farm-to-table joints; I'm talking about a spiritual, nostalgic, perfectly executed slice of Americana. I'm talking about the **Damn Fine Cherry Pie** at **Twede's Cafe** in North Bend, Washington.

## Twin Peaks and the Birth of a Legend

Twede's Cafe occupies a unique place in American pop culture. As the real-life Double R Diner featured in David Lynch's iconic television series _Twin Peaks_, it has become a pilgrimage site for fans of the show. But the cafe's fame extends far beyond television—it's a genuine institution that has served Washington travelers for generations.

The story begins in 1946 when Floyd and Doris Twede purchased what was then a small roadside cafe. They renamed it Twede's Cafe, and over the decades, it evolved into the quintessential Pacific Northwest diner. The cafe's appearance in _Twin Peaks_ (as the Double R Diner) cemented its place in popular culture, but its real legacy lies in the quality of its food and service.

## The Pie Philosophy

At Twede's, pie isn't just dessert—it's a culinary philosophy. The cafe serves over a dozen varieties daily, each made from scratch using traditional techniques passed down through generations. But the cherry pie stands above all others as the signature achievement.

### The Crust: A Masterclass in Flakiness

Twede's crust represents the pinnacle of American pie-making. Made with a proprietary blend of flour, butter, and just enough water to bring it together, the crust achieves that elusive balance of tenderness and structure. It's rolled thin but maintains enough substance to support the generous filling.

The crimping technique—those perfectly even flutes around the edge—speaks to decades of practice. Each pie is hand-crimped, ensuring no two are exactly alike but all achieve the same level of perfection.

### The Filling: Cherry Perfection

The cherry filling is a masterpiece of balance. Fresh cherries (when in season) or preserved cherries (during the off-season) are cooked with exactly the right amount of sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice. The result is a filling that's neither too sweet nor too tart—perfectly balanced to let the natural cherry flavor shine through.

What elevates Twede's cherry pie above others is the texture. The filling maintains just enough chunkiness to remind you of real fruit, while the cornstarch provides the ideal thickness. It's not runny, not gelatinous—just perfect.

### The Ice Cream Union

Ordering the cherry pie à la mode transforms it into something transcendent. Twede's vanilla ice cream is made in-house using a custard base that results in exceptional richness and smoothness. When it melts into the warm pie, it creates a symphony of temperatures and textures that's nothing short of magical.

## Beyond the Pie: A Complete Dining Experience

While the pie rightfully dominates the conversation, Twede's offers a complete menu that reflects Pacific Northwest sensibilities.

### Breakfast Excellence

Twede's all-day breakfast menu is a tribute to the region's logging and outdoor heritage. Flapjacks are light and fluffy, made with a batter that's been perfected over decades. The hash browns are crispy on the outside, tender within, and the bacon achieves that perfect balance of chewiness and crispiness.

### Lunch and Dinner Options

The lunch menu features classic diner fare with a Pacific Northwest twist. The tuna melt uses local albacore, the BLT showcases Washington's famous bacon, and the club sandwich is a towering monument to the form.

### The Coffee Ritual

No visit to Twede's is complete without a "damn fine cup of coffee." The coffee is fresh, hot, and served in thick ceramic mugs that retain heat perfectly. It's the kind of coffee that warms you from the inside out, perfect for Washington mornings or evenings.

## The Cultural Phenomenon

Twede's has achieved a level of cultural significance that transcends its role as a restaurant. The cafe has become a touchstone for Pacific Northwest identity, representing the region's blend of rugged individualism and community spirit.

### Twin Peaks Legacy

The cafe's appearance in _Twin Peaks_ has created a unique cultural phenomenon. Fans of the show make pilgrimages to North Bend specifically to visit Twede's, often ordering the cherry pie while discussing their favorite episodes. The cafe has embraced this legacy, maintaining a section of Twin Peaks memorabilia that includes photos from the show's production.

### Local Tradition

After navigating the steep grades and tight curves, Twede's represents a well-earned rest stop. The cafe's warm interior and hearty food provide the perfect counterpoint to the rugged beauty outside.

## Seasonal Evolution

Twede's menu evolves with the seasons, reflecting Washington's agricultural bounty. Spring brings rhubarb pies made from local stalks. Summer explodes with berry varieties using Washington's famous fruits. Fall showcases apple and pumpkin pies made from regional orchards. Winter brings comfort pies like pecan and pumpkin.
