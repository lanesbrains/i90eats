# The Only Pie Worth Pulling Off I-90 For: A Visit to Twede's Cafe

If you've driven the entire I-90, you deserve a reward. Forget the fancy farm-to-table joints; I'm talking about a spiritual, nostalgic, perfectly executed slice of Americana. I'm talking about the **Damn Fine Cherry Pie** at **Twede's Cafe** in North Bend, Washington.

Located mere minutes off Exit 31, Twede's is, of course, the legendary **Double R Diner** from the classic series _Twin Peaks_. But you don't need to be a fan of David Lynch to appreciate a masterclass in diner food. This place is the final boss of I-90 comfort food.

### Beyond the Nostalgia: What Makes This Pie King-Worthy?

It's about the execution. The cherry filling is balanced—not overly sweet—allowing the tartness of the fruit to cut through the buttery, flaky crust. It’s served warm, and if you order it à la mode, the vanilla bean ice cream melts just right into the warm filling. This is a pie built on tradition, served with a "damn fine cup of coffee" that is black, hot, and exactly what you need after 3,000 miles of highway.

While the cafe offers fantastic all-day breakfast—and you know I approve of all-day breakfast—the pie is the anchor. It's the moment of pure, unadulterated pleasure that justifies the drive.

### The Full I-90 Experience

Before settling in for your slice of pie, you might consider hitting up one of the [Top BBQ Spots in Snoqualmie](/top-bbq-snoqualmie-i90-smoky-stops-2025) for a smoky Washington dinner, then finish the day with this slice of history. Twede's proves that sometimes, the simplest food is the most powerful.
