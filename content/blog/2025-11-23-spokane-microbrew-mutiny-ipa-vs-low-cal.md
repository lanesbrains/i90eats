# 🍻 Spokane's Microbrew Mutiny: IPA Tradition vs. The Low-Cal Trend

**Spokane, WA** - The I-90 corridor through the Inland Northwest is a hop-lover's paradise, built on the back of the massive, aggressively hoppy **India Pale Ale (IPA)**. For over a decade, the bigger, the hazier, the higher the ABV, the better.

But a new wave is washing over Spokane's craft breweries: the **Low-Calorie, Crisp, and Crushable** beer trend. This shift has created a silent but intense "Microbrew Mutiny," where traditional brewers feel betrayed by the public's thirst for lighter, less flavor-intensive options.

## The IPA Defender's Lament

Spokane's original craft breweries built their reputation on West Coast IPAs—bitter, resinous, and unapologetic. The taste profile was a statement, a defiance of the national lager brands.

"People used to come to the taproom for a real beer, a 7.5% ABV IPA that tasted like hops and grit," says Mark Johnson, a long-time brewer near Exit 281. "Now, all the requests are for 'light IPAs,' 'session pilsners,' or God forbid, a 'hard seltzer' on our taps. We are being pressured to water down our craft just to cater to a diet trend."

The IPA traditionalists argue that low-cal beers lack the complexity and depth that truly define craft brewing.

## The New Trend: Health-Conscious Craft

The new breweries, and the changing palates of drinkers, are pivoting hard toward clean, crisp, and low-calorie options. They argue that the market has spoken: people want multiple beers without the weight, the calorie count, or the high ABV.

"It’s not about watering anything down; it's about crafting a _better_ light beer," counters Jenna Kim, a new Spokane brewery owner. "Our customers are outdoorsy, health-conscious, and active. They want a post-hike beer that doesn't ruin their calorie count or their afternoon. That’s not betrayal, that's responding to the demand."

## The Taps are Turning

The conflict is visible on tap lists across the city:

- **Old School:** Heavy focus on Imperial IPA, Stout, and Porter.
- **New School:** Dominated by Kettle Sours, Crisp Lagers, Hard Seltzers, and "Haze Lite" IPAs.

The I-90 driver must now choose: The unapologetic, high-octane hop punch that built the scene, or the modern, lighter, and more forgiving "lifestyle" beer. Spokane’s brewing soul is currently stuck between a high-ABV rock and a low-cal hard place.
