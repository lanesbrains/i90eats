# Best Breakfast in Spokane Along I‑90: Hidden Gems Worth Pulling Off For

If you know me, you know breakfast is the one meal I do **not** play around with. Spokane's got a pretty stacked lineup, but only a few spots along I‑90 rise to that “turn the car around” level.

Here are the spots that consistently deliver the goods—from pancakes the size of hubcaps to eggs Benedict built different.

## 1. Frankie Doodle’s — The Classic Spokane Greasy Spoon

If you're craving pure nostalgia and big portions, Frankie Doodle’s hits like a warm hug from 1997.  
**Must‑try:** Chicken‑fried steak & eggs (you already know how I feel about CFS).  
**Vibe:** Blue‑collar breakfast that’ll keep you full until Idaho.

## 2. Chaps Coffee Co. — Bougie but Worth It

Rustic farmhouse vibes, photogenic plates, and pastries that somehow taste even better than they look.  
**Must‑try:** The lemon curd pastries. Unreal.

## 3. The Yards Bruncheon — Kendall Yards Crowd‑Pleaser

Always busy, always worth it. Fresh ingredients and portions that don’t insult you.  
**Must‑try:** Fried chicken & waffles (crispy every time).

## Why Spokane Breakfast Hits Different

Maybe it’s the cold mornings, maybe it’s the mountain air, or maybe Spokane just knows breakfast better than anywhere else on I‑90. Either way, these stops are legit.
